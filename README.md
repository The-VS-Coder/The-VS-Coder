- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @The-VS-Coder
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in getting better at coding and creating more projects!
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use C# in unity and how to create webpages with pure code.
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am a CANADIAN AP student which isn't the same as US AP so thats sad I guess.
